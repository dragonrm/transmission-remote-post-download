# transmission-remote-post-download
A quick and dirty script to process torrents after download finishes

This isn't very clean code I'm sure. I'm not a programmer or developer by trade. I search online to find a scipt for 
handeling torrents with transmission-remote but what I found didn't deal with spaces very well.

Have fun with!
